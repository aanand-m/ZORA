Prashant P. Deshmukh,Reviewed in India on 30 April 2024,5.0,Superb…..very happy with purchase,"At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn’t purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome"

Kumar Himanshu,Reviewed in India on 28 April 2024,4.0,Does the job,"I've switched from iPhone 13 to 15 and this transition definitely feels worthwhile. Got this for 66,000 using my SBI credit card + ongoing offers on Amazon.The delivery was secure and the packaging was impenetrable. The device interface is user friendly and the camera......well it's iPhone so you already know."
Rounak,Reviewed in India on 27 April 2024,1.0,Overheating Problem Persists with iPhone 15 – A Disappointing 6-Month Review,"Six months in and the iPhone 15 is a letdown. It overheats to the point of being unbearable to hold, even after multiple software updates hoping to fix the issue. The problem is so persistent that it overshadows any other feature the phone might offer. Using it becomes a test of endurance rather than enjoyment. Apple’s failure to address this glaring flaw is unacceptable, especially for a device that costs a premium. Buyers should steer clear—your money is better spent elsewhere."

Adhi,Reviewed in India on 27 April 2024,3.0,Good phone but it has heating issues,"The phone heats a lot while using even for basic tasks like scrolling websites or social media. Battery drain is also evident. The battery life is similar to my 4 year old used iPhone 11. Which says a lot about the battery life. Hope apple fixes this, else will likely move to Samsung or Nothing next"
