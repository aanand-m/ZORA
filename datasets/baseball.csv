Akhil Soman,Reviewed in India on 29 March 2022,5.0,I Loved IT!!,"It's quite nice product. For 300 bucks it's better than what I expected. I've seen cheap Baseball bats they're super lightweight and they're made cheap.. This is not like that. It does have a classic weight attached to it. I used to carry an iron rod pullup bar for self defense in my vehicle but honestly that was too dangerous and could've seriously harmed someone. This is perfect. Looks nice, feels good and it's well built. People were complaining about white coating on it. It was just fine saw dust. Coat it with some oil and wipe clean for best looks."
